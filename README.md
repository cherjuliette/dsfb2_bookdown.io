# Bookdown in R (dsfb2_bookdown)
The contents of a bookdown are .Rmd files knitted together to form a book. This is particularly handy when writing research analysis, assays and even a portfolio.

For the course Data Science for Biology 2 (dsfb2) I have developed my skills with R, which I demonstrate with the included analysis. 

## (00) Acquiring Extra Skills

<br> 
During the course we are given 32 hours in which we are encouraged to learn a new skill, related to Data Science, to supplement our portfolio and ability as Data Scientists. I have chosen to spend this 32 hours learning HTML and CSS and will apply this skill to a portfolio I made using HTML. This portfolio exists out of 3 html files which I use as pages. With CSS I made grids that display projects which I will perform in the short-term future. With HTML and 1 JavaScript I display the projects I have already performed. Regularly this bookdown would be presented as a portfolio but because I have transformed my portfolio in a HTML document, I may refer certain assignments to specific GitHub repos by me.


## (001) Reproducible Research
In laboratory based research the reproducibility crisis has resulted in many papers and conclusions being called into questions. With the rise of Data Science, research may now be held to a magnifying glass. The concept of reproducibility is that a researcher who performs an analysis either in a laboratory or by coding, is able to show the data used and the code used which has led them to form their conclusion. If I then were to add to that research and would test that code or laboratory protocol, I would be able to see the same findings as my predecessor.

In this assignment I give an example of reproducibility in Data Science by running the code produced by [Riffomonas](https://github.com/riffomonas/vaccination_attitudes).

## (001_2) Dose Response Analysis of the *C. elegans*
In the laboratory of the Institute of Life Sciences a research on dose expose of Napthalene, Decane and 2,6-diisopropylnaphthalene. The question the analysis is intended to answer is **Does (a certain concentration) of the test compound lead to less offspring in the C. elegans?**


## (002_005) Data Management Using the Guerilla Method
+ File and folder management using the Guerilla Method.
+ Reference storage using Zotoro and BibTex.

## (003) Future Ambitions
*Only look back to see how far you've come.* **(Winnie the Poe)**
I've revised a three step plan for developing myself from novice to proficient in Data Scientist and Molecular Biologist. These steps are **3 months**, **1 year** and **3 years**.

## (007) Evaluating Cases of Dengue Fever and Flu from 2002 to 2015
Manual download of the Dengue Fever dataset. The data was made tidy in R, and in SQLite using the DBeaver software I inserted tables.
With the gapminder package I sought to establish if there is a correlation between GDP and life expectancy.

## (008) Making R package rcolorUtrecht
Here I show how I made the R package rcolorUtrecht. This package provides 16 color palettes derived from street art found in Utrecht. Inspired by the {dutchmasters} color palette by [EdwinTh](https://github.com/EdwinTh/dutchmasters).

## (009) Visualizing the number of COVID-19 cases and number of deaths
With a COVID-19 dataset downloaded from the [ECDC website](https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/en/covid-19/data), I attempt to perform a parametrized report. I do this by making a graph on the COVID-19 cases and COVID-19 related deaths.
