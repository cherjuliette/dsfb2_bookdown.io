# Hi there!

## About Me
I'm a Molecular Biologist with a passion for Data Science.
My ultimate goal is to become a Data Scientist proficient in Bash, R and Python. 

## Future Ambitions

Now that I've been given the tools to undertake basic Data Science analysis, my ultimate objective is to be a Molecular Biologist with professional Data Science skills. I've designed a three-step approach to achieve my aim of learning the programming languages Bash and R. These steps are time blocks of three months, one year, and five years in which I will pursue an internship that mixes lab work with Data Science analysis and then pursue a position that will allow me to advance and gain expertise in my profession.

### **3 Months Goals**

+ RNA Sequence Analysis in R

During the minor I performed a RNA sequencing analysis of the ONECUT2 gene. To practice with this analysis I will import SRA identifiers from the BTK gene, and perform the analysis in R.
Mutated BTK genes cause faulty B-cell formation which in turn causes the disease X-Linked Agammaglobulinemia (XLA).
Previously during my studies I did a project on the laboratory which included mutation analysis of healthy patients and patients with XLA in DNAbaser. To make this analysis more time efficient I will do this in R.

+ Sentiment Analysis of The Raven by Edgar Allan Poe

This has been something which I have wanted to do for years. When studying literature the climax and denouement of a novel is determined by a specific undertone, however I wish to prove these segments with sentiment analysis.
After all, as Heinrich von Schlegel said Every art should become science, and every science should become art.

<br>

+ R Shiny app to track my pet's health  
My pet has a little vaccination notebook in which his medical history is stored. My pet is 8 years old now and the notebook has been lost for 6 years. While I care greatly for my pet's health I intend to make a R Shiny app that tracks his medical history, vaccination history and routine checkups.

<br>

+ Learn the basics of Matlab  
Recently I've landed my dream internship which will combine Data Science with genetics research. In this laboratory the programming language Matlab is widely used which necessitates me to learn at least the basics before I start.

### **1 Year Goals**
This is the year I'll be doing an internship in a laboratory. In addition to expanding on my present knowledge with laboratory procedures, I intend to use this year to hone my Data Science skills.
How will I accomplish this? While data science is a flourishing field, not many laboratories fully utilize its capabilities. The key goal is to apply my existing skills to the project that I will be working on during my internship and then expand on these by improving an analysis that they routinely perform.

In addition to this, I will continue the project Gender Determination of the Corvus corax in R.


+ Learn how to use Python Pandas
The language Python is widely used 

<br>

### **5 Years Goals**
In five years time I will have finished my degree and started my first job that uses my degree. These are the years in which I may fully focus on honing my Data Science skills. This is because I will have a minor in Data Science as well as an internship which may add to my credentials. To reach my objective of becoming a proficient Data Scientist. See what point I will focus on below. 

+ Gain more experience with DNA isolation.

My educational background has provided me with many opportunities during which I couuld practice DNA isolation with. There are several methods for DNA isolation, primarily with the isopropanol method and ethanol extraction, and I would like to develop my skills in DNA isolation with the Chelex method.

+ Gain more experience with sequencing.

My experience with sequencing as of yet is purely theoretical. Sequencing however, either with DNA or RNA can provide us with much more profound information in Genetics. This is why, through my job, I will seek to gain practical experience with sequencing.

+ Gain more experience with mutation analysis in Bash and R.

In genetics and in medicine the benefits of mutation analysis is recognized. Through my job I will seek to build on my previous experiences, provided by my education, with mutation analysis.

+ Make an interactive and elaborate R Shiny app that tracks pet health.

This project is intended to help me fully and intrinsically understand R Shiny, which may be supplemented with HTML and CSS. I will first do this by making an health monitor in R Shiny for my pet, and then apply this method to something more universal. This way the universal may then also be used for (my) other pets.

+ Sentiment Analysis of Several Other Novels.

This is also a short term goal however to get a better feel for this I will apply sentiment analysis in R to several other novels.

Keywords: sentiment analysis, R
Learn for to use Pandas from Python.

Pandas is frequently used in data science and performs functions comparable to those found in R. To broaden my Data Scientist skills, I will learn how to use Pandas from Python.

+ Data Cleaning in SQL

Data cleaning is a very big part of Data Science and Data Analysis. When we wish to analyse data retrieved from areas where tidy data or agile workflows are not used, data must first be cleaned. Currently I only do this with the janitor package in R, I would like to clean data in SQL before tidying in R.

**I'm currently looking for an internship that combines Data Science with Molecular Biology.**

Now that my minor Data Science is nearing the end and I am specialized in Molecular Biology, I am looking for an internship which would allow me to improve my programming skills while also facilitating my laboratory experiences.

### Education

**Institute for Life Sciences (HU)**

B.S. in Molecular Biology

Utrecht, The Netherlands

2023

Specialization courses: Biotechnology, Advanced Labtools, Tumorcell biology
Minor: Data Science using Bash, R

**Vocational School Beverwijk**

Vocational Education diploma (MBO) in Biotechnology

Beverwijk, The Netherlands

2015

During my studies I was taught the preliminary experiments for big researches which has resulted in my experience with laboratory techniques such as bacteria identification and PCR.

### Research Experience

**Automating Peak Identification using R**

Institute for Life Sciences (HU)

Utrecht, The Netherlands

March 2022 - June 2022

- I was involved in writing a for-loop in R which counted the number of peaks and calculated the beats per minute (BPM).
- Made a R Shiny app for graph visualization to make the analysis easier for second year students.

**Mutation Analysis of the BTK gene Institute of Life Sciences**

Institute for Life Sciences (HU)

Utrecht, The Netherlands

2018

-  The immune deficiency X‑linked agammaglobulinemia (XLA) is caused by mutations in the beta tyrosine kinase (BTK) gene. The weakened
immune system is directly related to faulty B‑cell formation. 
- DNA was isolated and amplified using PCR from XLA patients and healthy patients.
- Custom primers were created to target the BTK gene, which was then sequenced. The location of mutations was discovered using the software
DNA baser.

## Expanding My Skill Set
During my minor course Data Science I was presented with the option of expanding my skills by learning basic skills of a new programming language in (at least) 32 hours. I chose to fill this time by learning how to use HTML and CSS. Why did I do this? Not because I have any aspirations of becoming a UI or UX designer however during my life, especially in the last view years, I often stumbled upon moments during which I wished I had basic skills with HTML. Currently I am participating in a project that automates peak identification for which I need to make a R Shiny app. After I have finished the minor I intend to practice using R Shiny by making an app that stores and shows the medical history of my pet. That process implements HTML and CSS quite heavily, at least if you want the app to become more elaborate. To help myself in this process I have made a HTML portfolio in which I display all my projects that I show here.
